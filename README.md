This repository contains a Firefox add-on that modifies the user-agent string sent for requests to [bing.com](http://bing.com) AND the new [Copilot.Microsoft.com](https://copilot.microsoft.com). It modifies the user-agent string to appear as if the request is coming from the Microsoft Edge browser. It works for both desktop and mobile browsers. Bing Chat is currently available to all browsers, but Microsoft has set conversation length limits to browsers other than Microsoft Edge.

## Installation

Currently, Download the file from the releases section. I am planning to publish this fork to Firefox Add-ons soon.
ssues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
